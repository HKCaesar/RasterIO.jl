# Code Organization
We separate the lower-level GDAL-facing routines from the higher-level RasterIO ones.

## lower-level
In the lower-level GDAL-facing routines, we have the following files

- `src/gdal_cdefs.jl` -- generated by Clang (with manual edits [to make it work] in the `capi` branch)
- `src/gdal_cfuns.jl` -- generated by Clang (with manual edits [to make it work] in the `capi` branch)
- `src/gdal_functions.jl` -- hand-picked and hand-written, mostly corresponding to functions in `src/gdal_cfuns.jl`, but with error-checking, and docstrings; this will be the file that developers refer to and modify (instead of `src/gdal_cfuns.jl`) when developing code for higher-level routines (so that `src/gdal_cdefs.jl` and `src/gdal_cfuns.jl` can be generated for subsequent versions of GDAL without too much pain)

This is the layer where

- pointer arithmetic should be handled
- error messages should be dealt with
- C-type immutables/structs (for the express purpose of interfacing with the GDAL library, rather than for users) should be defined, and dealt with locally

We should not be defining our own RasterIO types here, unless it's needed (for the sole purpose of interfacing with libgdal).

## higher-level
The higher-level user-facing routines are organized into

- `src/raster_types.jl`
- `src/raster_functions.jl`
- `src/RasterIO.jl`
